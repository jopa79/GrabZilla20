## Phase 3-5: Advanced Functionality

| Module | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| progress_tracker.rs | ✅ | Fixed and enabled |
| retry_manager.rs | ✅ | Fixed and enabled |
| security_manager.rs | ✅ | Fixed and enabled |
| secure_process.rs | ✅ | Fixed orphan rule violation and enabled |
| ffmpeg_controller.rs | ✅ | Fixed partially moved value issue and enabled |
| download_manager.rs | ✅ | Fixed lifetime issues and type mismatches and enabled |
| update_manager.rs | ❌ | Not fixed yet (missing dependency) |
| commands.rs | ❌ | Not enabled yet (conflicts with commands_simple.rs) |

## Issues Fixed

1. **Orphan Rule Violation**: Fixed in `secure_process.rs` by replacing the `From<Command>` implementation with a helper method
2. **Partially Moved Value**: Fixed in `ffmpeg_controller.rs` by restructuring how stdout is handled
3. **Lifetime Issues**: Fixed in `download_manager.rs` by creating separate processor types and removing self references in async blocks
4. **Type Mismatches**: Fixed in `download_manager.rs` by creating adapter functions to convert between progress types
5. **Unused Variables**: Fixed by adding underscore prefixes or making the variables useful

## Issues Remaining

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Still need to add `tauri-plugin-updater` for the update manager
2. **Command Conflicts**: Need to resolve conflicts between `commands.rs` and `commands_simple.rs`

## Recommendations

1. **Add Missing Dependencies**: Install `tauri-plugin-updater` using `cargo add tauri-plugin-updater`
2. **Resolve Command Conflicts**: Either merge the commands or use only one set
3. **Complete Testing**: Test the enabled modules with actual downloads and conversions
4. **Update Documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect the current state of the project

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress in fixing the compilation errors and enabling most of the advanced modules. The application now compiles successfully with the following modules enabled:
- url_parser.rs
- progress_tracker.rs
- retry_manager.rs
- security_manager.rs
- secure_process.rs
- ffmpeg_controller.rs
- download_manager.rs

Only the update_manager.rs and commands.rs modules remain disabled. The application is now ready for more comprehensive testing of the enabled functionality.
